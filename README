Supportable is the easiest, most efficient way to provide customer support for your business. 

Simply create an account for your company, add some employees, and configure how your automated support robot should behave. Your employees hang out in a common chat room, discussing issues and sharing files with each other. When a customer comes to your support site, he is automatically taken to to his own chat room where your automated bot will attempt to answer his questions, using the information you provided it. If the customer still would like to speak to a real person, your employees will be notified, at which point one of them can join that customer's chat room to discuss the problem.
