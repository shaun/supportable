Dear <%= @rep.full_name %>,

Your manager, <%= @manager.full_name %>, would like you to start using supportable.com, the easiest way to provide quick and efficient customer support to your customers. To log in, go to http://localhost:3000/<%= @company.url_name %>/employees/login and use your credentials:

E-mail: <%= @rep.email %>
Password: <%= @password %>

It would be a good idea to change your password the first time you log in.

Thanks!
The Supportable Team
